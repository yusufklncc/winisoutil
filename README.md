This PowerShell script allows you to directly modify your Windows 11 ISO files, enabling you to configure the operating system to your needs before installation. You can remove bloatware applications, improve privacy settings, apply performance-oriented registry tweaks, and integrate your frequently used drivers or updates directly into the ISO.

This tool features both an interactive menu that lets you make step-by-step selections and an automatic mode that can apply a previously saved configuration file to automate the entire process.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Language Interface**: Support for Turkish and English.
- **Interactive and Automatic Modes**:
  - **Manual Mode**: Choose step-by-step which components to remove or which settings to apply.
  - **Automatic Mode**: Save your settings to a `.json` file and apply the same configuration to other ISOs.
- **ISO Cleanup**:
  - Save space by removing unwanted Windows editions (e.g., Home, Pro, SE) from the ISO.
  - Clean up unnecessary Windows applications (Bloatware) before installation.
- **Integration**:
  - Add critical Windows updates (`.msu`) to the ISO file.
  - Integrate your drivers (`.inf`) directly into the ISO to avoid post-installation driver hassles.
- **Detailed Configuration**:
  - **Privacy and Telemetry**: Disable data collection services.
  - **UI Tweaks**: Align the taskbar to the left, restore the classic right-click menu, and configure desktop icons.
  - **Performance Improvements**: Disable unnecessary services and apply registry settings that boost system performance.
- **Reliability**:
  - If an error occurs during the process, a `trap` mechanism ensures a safe exit without leaving behind "dirty" files (like a mounted image).
  - Automatically downloads necessary tools (oscdimg, mkisofs) from the internet if they are not found.
